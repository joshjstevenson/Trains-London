Working progress. Updates are lazy.

A web user interface has been created to eventually allow a user to enter any Transport For London Underground / Overground station
and be returned with both inbound and outbound arrival predictions. Made possible using the TFL public API.

There are a few details for the user input and translation of that input to then fetch information to be ironed out, as well as formatting the information
visaully on the UI. This will hopefully be addressed this week.

After this, additional features will be considered.
